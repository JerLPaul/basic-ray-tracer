# Javascript Ray Tracer

## Description
This is one of my old ray tracing projects that draws lighting, shadows and reflections with pure javascript. The program takes either a scene file with spheres, or a scene and an object file. The program will draw the scene and the corresponding objects stated in the scene file using a recursive rayu tracing approach. The project takes an scene file as well as an optional object file (.obj) and draws the images pixel by pixel. 

## How to run
* Fork the repository
* Run the command: `python -m http.server`
* On your browser, go to `localhost:8000`

## Limitations
This Ray tracer does not currently do antialiasing and proper transparency. They will be features added in the future.
