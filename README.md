# Javascript Ray Tracer

## Description
The repo provides a basic ray tracer built in pure JavaScript. The project takes an scene file as well as an optional object file (.obj) and draws the images pixel by pixel. 

## How to run
* Fork the repository
* Run the command: `python -m http.server`
* On your browser, go to `localhost:8000`

## Limitations
This Ray tracer does not currently do antialiasing and proper transparency. They will be features added in the future.
